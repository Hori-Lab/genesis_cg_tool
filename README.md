# GENESIS-CG-tool

This project helps you prepare topology and coordinate files for coarse-grained simulations in the MD package GENESIS.

## Usage

Please use the following command to show the basic usage of this tool:
```bash
./src/aa_2_cg.jl -h
```

A full documentation can be found from the [wiki-page of this project](https://github.com/noinil/genesis_cg_tools/wiki).

## Dependencies

Please run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
./opt/dependency.jl
```

## Tutorials
